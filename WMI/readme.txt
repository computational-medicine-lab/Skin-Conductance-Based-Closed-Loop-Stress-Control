# WMI closed-loop architecture,
# the swtich is on when the open loop analysis is needed,
# The main file to run is WMI.slx,
# The files In.fis and Ex.fis are related to the fuzzy systems for both inhibition and excitation classes.
# The data files (AMP1.mat, PHA1.mat , and N1.mat) are the offline obtained coefficients to simulate the environmental stimuli for stress tasks,
